# Module 04 Mini-Project: Word Guess

In this activity, you will work with a group to build a game using JavaScript and Web APIs.

## Instructions

The completed application should meet the following criteria:

* As a user, I want to start the game by clicking on a button. 

* As a user, I want to try and guess a word by filling in a number of blanks that match the number of letters in that word.

* As a user, I want the game to be timed. 

* As a user, I want to win the game when I have guessed all the letters in the word.

* As a user, I want to lose the game when the timer runs out before I have guessed all the letters.

* As a user, I want to see my total wins and losses on the screen. 

### Specifications

* When a user presses a letter key, the user's guess should be captured as a key event.

* When a user correctly guesses a letter, the corresponding blank "_" should be replaced by the letter. For example, if the user correctly selects "a", then "a _ _ a _" should appear. 

* When a user wins or loses a game, a message should appear and the timer should stop. 

* When a user clicks the start button, the timer should reset. 

* When a user refreshes or returns to the brower page, the win and loss counts should persist.
